	Started project Number three, following the instructions that were given in the handout.
	
	1st Error, tried to use de operator += with two arguments, one being a pointer and the other one being the value I wanted to add, in the proccess of fixing it. I was thinking about using a similar method to add after, but what I actually need to do with this method is only add in the end of the list, which will make it less complicate.
	
	Fixed, just assumed to add the node to the tail and update the tail.
	
	1st Problem with the overload for the = operator, I dont know how to start it, I will skip this one for now and comeback later.
	2nd Problem, overloading operator -=, segmentation fault, not sure what the problem is. I followed the path from the lecture pdf from canvas to delete a node
	
	end of the first day, everything is compiling.
	
	STILL NEEDS TESTING: 
		operator==
		operator+
		operator/
		operator-
		
	ERRORS:
		operator-=
		operator=

	Started to work again on project 3. objectives: write operator= and operator-=, start testing
	
	After testing and debbuging the operator/ I started to understand better, I was using all the comparisons to run until getting to the tail, but in my implementation, the tail is still a value, the tail->next() is not, so I need to check for NULL, not for tail.
	
	TESTED AND WORKING:
			constructors
			clear()
			size()
			contains()
			operator/
			operator+=
			operator<<
	NEEDS REEWRITING:
			operator==
			operator+
			operator-
			operator=
			operator-=
		All of these needs to be in the same way of thinking of operator/

	Started to reewrite the methods by folowing the same way of thinking
	First attempts of testing of the day gave me some different errors.

	TESTED AND WORKING:
			constructors
			clear()
			size()
			contains()
			operator/
			operator+=
			operator<<
			operator==
			operator+= 
			operator+
			operator- 
			find()
	NEEDS REEWRITING:
			operator-= (still problems trying to figure out how to delete, find, not sure where the error is)			I decided to delete everything and start over in the next day. Both the remove() and the operator-= 
			operator= 

April/2/2020
	Started to look over operator-= again. Problems fixed, it looks like it is working correctly. I will start working on operator =
	In order to make the operator= work I need a way to return a pointer to "this". 
	Instead of trying to create a new set and setting "this" equal to this new one, it will be easier to manipulate "this" the only thing is that i will not be able to call "this"+="something" i will need to write another method that does exactly the same thing in order to acheive this.
	
	Everything tested and working, now just need to comment and put the bigO notations
